# Multi-Omics Cancer Dataset

## Overview

This dataset is a curated subset of the MLOmics benchmark database for cancer machine learning research. It contains four cancer types with Top-feature selected multi-omics data, prepared for machine learning and bioinformatics tasks such as cancer subtype classification, clustering, and multi-omics integration.

The dataset includes four omics modalities for each cancer type:

- mRNA expression
- miRNA expression
- DNA Methylation (Methy)
- Copy Number Variation (CNV)

Only the **Top** feature version is included in this dataset.

Top features are identified through ANOVA statistical testing according to p-values, selecting the most significant features among samples. This approach helps:
- reduce noisy and irrelevant features,
- unify feature dimensions across datasets,
- improve computational efficiency,
- and potentially improve machine learning performance.
